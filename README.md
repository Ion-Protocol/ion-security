# Security

This repository houses all things security related to Ion Protocol.

## Exploits

The Exploits section of this repository is dedicated to the documentation and analysis of significant security incidents that have impacted lending protocols within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. By studying these cases, we aim to identify potential vulnerabilities within our own Ion Protocol and take proactive measures to safeguard against similar threats. Each documented exploit includes a comprehensive breakdown of the incident, technical analysis of the exploit methods used, and the lessons learned.
